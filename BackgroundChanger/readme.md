# BackgroundChanger

You should place this file in the `Plugins` folder of the DiscordInjections project.

This switches your background every 10 minutes to a random URL in the pool.

Please populate the `get urls()` with your own URLs. They must use https!

## Note

This plugin requires some sort of theme that modifies the backgrounds of some components. The plugin removes certain extraneous backgrounds, but does not modify specific components such as the guild-wrapper or main content.
