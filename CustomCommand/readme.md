# CustomCommand

This enables a sort of custom slash (/) command system, without having to use a selfbot.

Simply place your commands in the `Commands` directory, and execute them in-chat by pressing `shift` and then `tab`.

For example:

```
/ping
```

After pressing shift and tab, this would get turned into

```
Pong!
```
